DSLstats 5.8.x
-------------

DSLstats is a DSL router monitoring program for Linux and Windows. It's free
and open source, and is released under GPL2/LGPL.

In principle this program should work with any Broadcom-based DSL router which
has a fully functioning telnet interface with access to the Broadcom CLI.

Please note that the "Telnet password" item may in some routers be different
from the password used for logging into the GUI interface. For example, in the
case of the Huawei HG612, if you change the GUI password, this does not change
the telnet password, which remains as "admin".

Installation
------------
There is no installation as such. After extracting the files from the downloaded
archive, copy the folder with all its files to a directory of your choosing.
This directory should be one where you have full read/write permission. 
Double-click on the executable (dslstats or dslstats.exe) to run the program.

On first running the program, go to the Configuration tab and fill in the
login details for your router. You can select a router from the drop-down list
and edit the details as necessary, or just fill in the details manually.
If the router is a Thomson/Technicolor model, it's necessary to tick the option
"Router is a Thomson/Technicolor model". When you've finished, press the 
"Start recording" button at the left of the toolbar.

When the program is closed it saves its configuration settings in a file called
dslstats.ini - it doesn't write anything to the Windows Registry.
On Linux systems this configuration file is saved in ~/.dslstats/ and on Windows
systems it is saved (by default) in the same directory as the executable.
